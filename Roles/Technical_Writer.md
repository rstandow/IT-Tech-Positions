## Role Snapshot & Outlook

| Detail | Data | Source / Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US Average Annual Salary (Mid-Level)** | **$65,000 - $110,000+** | Senior technical writers and those specializing in API documentation or developer experience can reach $130k+. FAANG companies often pay $110k-$150k for experienced technical writers. |
| **2025 Demand Level** | **High** (Critical for AI/ML companies and developer tools) | As software becomes more complex and AI systems proliferate, the demand for clear documentation is increasing. Developer-facing companies are hiring aggressively. |
| **Projected Growth (Next 5-10 Years)** | **Strong Growth** (*~7-8%, driven by API economy and developer tools expansion*) | The rise of AI assistants paradoxically increases demand for precise technical writing - AI needs well-structured documentation to reference. |
| **Typical Entry-Level Education** | Bachelor's Degree (English, Communications, or Technical field) | Career switchers with strong writing skills can enter with portfolio. Technical background (CS, Engineering) is increasingly valued for API/developer docs. |

## Core Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA)

| Category | Knowledge (What you know) | Skills (What you can do) | Abilities (Soft Skills/Competencies) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Writing Fundamentals** | **Precise, unambiguous writing** - ability to eliminate jargon and clarify complex concepts. Grammar, style guides (Microsoft, Google, AP). | Write clear step-by-step instructions, API reference documentation, conceptual overviews, and troubleshooting guides. | **Empathy for the reader** - anticipate confusion points and address them proactively. |
| **Technical Proficiency** | Understanding of software development lifecycle, version control (Git), and **basic coding** (ability to read and understand code snippets in Python, JavaScript, etc.). | Use documentation tools: Markdown, reStructuredText, Sphinx, MkDocs, readme.io, GitBook. Navigate terminal/command line for testing procedures. | **Learn quickly** - ability to understand new technical concepts rapidly through reading code, talking to engineers, and hands-on testing. |
| **Information Architecture** | Content organization, taxonomy design, documentation site structure (getting started → tutorials → reference → troubleshooting). | Create documentation outlines, navigation structure, search-optimized headings. Use docs-as-code workflows (GitHub, CI/CD for documentation). | **User-centric thinking** - design documentation based on user journeys and common tasks, not just feature lists. |
| **API Documentation** | REST API concepts, GraphQL, authentication methods (OAuth, API keys), request/response formats (JSON, XML). | Write API reference pages with endpoint descriptions, parameters, example requests/responses. Test APIs using Postman or curl. | **Attention to detail** - API docs must be precise; a single wrong parameter type breaks developer trust. |

## Top Certifications and Training Pathways

Technical writing has few formal certifications, but these credentials and skills validate expertise:

| Credential Type | Provider | Focus Area | Notes on Progression |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Write the Docs Community** | Community-driven (free) | Best practices, networking with professional technical writers. | Attend WriteTheDocs conferences (SF, Portland, Prague) to network and learn. |
| **Google Technical Writing Courses** | Google (free) | Technical writing fundamentals, clear documentation. | Excellent free resource for beginners. |
| **Society for Technical Communication (STC)** | STC Certification | Industry-recognized technical communication credential. | More valuable in traditional industries (aerospace, medical devices) than tech startups. |
| **Portfolio Development** | Self-directed | Creating sample documentation, contributing to open source docs. | **Most important credential** - show 2-3 writing samples demonstrating API docs, tutorials, and conceptual overviews. |
