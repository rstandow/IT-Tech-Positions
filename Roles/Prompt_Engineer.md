## Role Snapshot & Outlook

| Detail | Data | Source / Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US Average Annual Salary (Entry-Mid Level)** | **$95,000 - $140,000+** | Senior roles specializing in model performance or fine-tuning can reach $200,000+. Large tech companies (Meta, Google, Anthropic) offer $140k-$230k total comp. Early 2025 data shows significant salary growth in this emerging field. |
| **2025 Demand Level** | **Emerging/High** (Skills integrating into many roles) | While "Prompt Engineer" as a standalone title may evolve, the skill of effective AI communication is becoming essential across technical roles. Companies view this as critical for maximizing AI ROI. |
| **Projected Growth (Next 5-10 Years)** | **Explosive Growth** (*~33%+ CAGR, evolving into core AI competency.*) | This role is fundamental to maximizing ROI from generative AI. May evolve from standalone role to core competency integrated into other technical positions. |
| **Typical Entry-Level Education** | **Technical Writing background + AI familiarity** OR Bachelor's Degree (Linguistics, Communications, or Computer Science) | **Strong writing and communication skills** are more important than traditional CS degrees for content-focused roles. Technical integration roles benefit from CS/NLP background. |
