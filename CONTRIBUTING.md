## Content Guidelines

### Tone and Style
- **Practical and honest** - this is a resource for real people making career decisions
- **Data-driven** - cite sources for salary ranges and growth projections
- **Beginner-friendly** - assume readers are exploring IT careers, not already experts
- **No gatekeeping** - welcome career changers and self-taught learners

### Salary Data
- Use early 2025 as the baseline year (update annually)
- Provide ranges, not point estimates (e.g., "$110k-$160k+" not "$135k")
- Cite sources: BLS, Glassdoor, Built In, Levels.fyi, etc.
- Note geographic variance where significant

### Avoiding Bias
- Include various educational paths (degree, bootcamp, self-taught)
- Acknowledge work-life balance and burnout realities
- Don't oversell roles - include challenges and downsides
- Represent diverse career paths (not just FAANG track)

## What We Don't Need

**Please don't submit:**
- Promotional content for specific bootcamps, courses, or companies (unless genuinely best-in-class and free/low-cost)
- Opinion pieces without data backing
- Content targeting experienced professionals (this repo is for newcomers and mid-career folks)
- AI-generated content without human review and fact-checking

## Quarterly Update Cycle

This repository aims to update salary data and BLS projections quarterly:
- **Q1 (Jan-Mar):** Update any roles with significant market changes
- **Q2 (Apr-Jun):** Spot-check high-volatility roles (AI/ML, Cloud, SRE)
- **Q3 (Jul-Sep):** Full refresh when BLS releases new projections
- **Q4 (Oct-Dec):** Minor updates and cleanup

If you'd like to help with quarterly updates, open an issue expressing interest!
