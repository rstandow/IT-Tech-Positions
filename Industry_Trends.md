## Immigration Policy and H-1B Visa Changes

**Background:**
The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, heavily used in tech (historically 65,000 annual cap + 20,000 for advanced degrees).

**Recent Changes (2023-2025):**
- Minimum wage requirements increased significantly (preventing wage suppression)
- Application fees raised: from ~$5,000 to $10,000+ per visa
- Lottery system reform prioritizing higher salaries
- Stricter auditing of "specialty occupation" requirements

**Impact on US IT Workers:**

**Positive Effects:**
- **Higher wages:** Companies must compete for US talent when visa costs rise
- **More entry-level opportunities:** Previously H-1B-dominated junior roles opening to US workers
- **Reduced wage compression:** Minimum wage requirements prevent undercutting

**Negative Effects:**
- **Talent shortage:** Harder to fill specialized roles (AI/ML, advanced security, niche platforms)
- **Remote outsourcing increase:** If can't hire via H-1B, companies hire remote contractors in India, Eastern Europe
- **Slower innovation:** Some startups struggle to fill critical technical roles

**Neutral/Complex:**
- **Onshore vs. offshore shift:** Companies building engineering hubs in Canada, Mexico, Latin America instead of bringing talent to US
- **Green card backlog:** Existing H-1B workers facing 10+ year wait for permanent residence creates retention issues

**Career Implications:**
- **US citizens/permanent residents:** Increased leverage in negotiations, especially for roles historically filled by visa holders
- **International students:** More competitive to secure US tech roles; need exceptional skills or target visa-friendly companies
- **Remote work advantage:** Companies hiring globally regardless of visa restrictions

**Non-political takeaway:** Immigration policy directly impacts IT labor supply. Restrictions increase wages for existing workers but may slow overall industry growth.
