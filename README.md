# IT Career Navigator: Roles, Salaries, and Career Strategy

**Note on Tooling & Accessibility:**
I am a senior DevOps engineer and sysadmin with mild dyslexia. I use LLMs and specialized AI coding tools as technical prosthetics to manage my dyslexia and assist with implementation. I architect the data structures, define the career logic, and verify the technical accuracy; the AI assists with the formatting, grammar, and repetitive data entry. If this repository feels unusually structured, it is an intentional choice for professional clarity.

## Strategic Career Principles

* **Specialization:** Roles like **Cloud Architect** or **DevOps** are broad. Real-world implementation often requires deep expertise in specific platforms (AWS, Azure, Terraform).
* **The 2-4 Year Cycle:** To maximize salary growth (15-30% increases), modern IT strategy favors changing roles every 2-4 years rather than long-term tenure at a single firm.
* **Education vs. Portfolio:** While degrees are often listed as requirements, in DevOps and Engineering, a strong portfolio and proven certifications frequently carry more weight.
* **The Communication Layer:** Technical writing is no longer optional. Whether you are an SRE or an AI Engineer, documenting models and systems is a core requirement.
